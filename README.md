# A New Spring

Work in progress- Responsive Angular/Angular Universal web application, utilising some of the latest features available, to demonstrate my ability within Front-end development.

This is the first draft of my portfolio, and still has a little way to go.

## Tech Within

- Angular Cli
- Angular Universal
- Node.js
- Express
- Webpack

## TODO

- Improve Text Content.
- Update "skills" page to improve design flow, and scalability with the "scale" Component.
- Add Feature: Parallel page transition; i.e. horizontal transitions.
- Add Feature: Media Queries; lower view height breaks things.
- Add Content: Contact Images; github. Some visual improvement needed.
- Bug: Initial page breaks page transition when not top of page.
- Add Service Worker goodness.

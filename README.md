## Eye of the World Update

This update will mark version 2.0 of this profile, my main focus is to take the route animations to a new level by incorporating horizontal transitions in conjunction with the vertical animation. I will also be spending some time improving the UI/UX, and updating content to fit the new layout.

### TODO

- UI Features:
  - Mouse grab navigation
  - Navigation Menu(s) styling clean-up
  - Add Navigation hints
- Content:
  - Add text content to all pages
    - Projects Page
    - About Page
    - Contact/Footer Page
  - Footer Page: contact images. ~~Some visual improvement needed.~~
- Styling Features:
  - Media Queries; lower view height breaks things.
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Improve server-side code.
- ~~Update CSS -> SASS~~
- ~~Update "skills" page to improve design flow, and scalability with the "scale" Component.~~
- ~~Add Feature: Parallel page transition; i.e. horizontal transitions.~~
- ~~Bug: Initial page breaks page transition when not top of page.~~
- ~~Add Service Worker goodness.~~

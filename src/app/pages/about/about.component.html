        <p>My name is Patrick Moloney. Base in South Africa with around six years of experience within web development.
        </p>
        <p>My knowledge has stemmed from a PHP and jQuery stack background- originally commissioned to create a web application
          assisting the people of the world to locate a good cup'o of coffee which utilised the google maps api and a whole
          lot of data capturing.
        </p>
        <p>To present I've been delving deep into the Javascript world, working for a telecommunications company, in which I
          have gained much proficiency. Focused on creating enterprize applications for internal use, I've coded a highly
          reusable and scalable Angular code base for current and future development.
        </p>
        <p>I've been getting a real kick out of creating highly performant code.</p>
        <p>In the near future I want to better my skills in both design and back-end development to push myself into being amongst
          the best full-stack web developers in South Africa.

          Hi there, my name is Patrick Moloney, I am a 26 year old web developer base in South Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my experience is in creating and maintaining enterprize applications- generally massive forms with complex validation. Reusablity, scalability, efficiency, performace and what-not.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like chess, bikes, billiards, and beer, but mostly coding and coffee... Front-end dev is my thing.
